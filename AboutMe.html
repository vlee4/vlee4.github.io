    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Growing up, as in most asian household I was originally given the dream that I should become a doctor.
        It aligned with my values and aspirations of helping others and seemed like a good fit for me so I naturally embraced this dream.
        Fast-forwarding to high school...
