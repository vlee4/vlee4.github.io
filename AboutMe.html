    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Growing up, I was fascinated by how things worked. I loved organizing things and naturally became a perfectionist. 
        Being an introvert, I preferred expressing myself through my creations, 
        whether that came in the form of drawing, painting, crafts, or even dancing and seeing the kinds of reactions they pulled out of people.

        Observant of those around me I developed an appreciation for people with the ability to help others
        <!-- In order to build a brighter future, I would like to devote myself to something I find meaningful, and inspire future generations. -->
