  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <pre>
    Growing up, I was fascinated by how things worked. I loved organizing things
    and naturally became a perfectionist. Being an introvert, I preferred
    expressing myself through my creations, whether that came in the form of
    drawing, painting, crafts, or even dancing and seeing the kinds of reactions
    they pulled out of people. Observant of those around me, I developed an
    appreciation for people with the ability to help others, wishing to do the
    same.

    Naturally, this desire led me to pursue a career in healthcare.
    Graduating from Loyola University Chicago with a B.S. in Biology (and a
    minor in Chemistry), I spent almost two years working in a hospital
    pharmacy. However, while my job was gratifying, at some point I found that I
    was not making the kind of impact that I wanted to be.

    My explorations into different careers thus led me to coding and technology. I enrolled in a
    Fullstack web development bootcamp at Fullstack Academy and learned the wide
    range of things technology made possible, how something could seemingly be
    made from nothing, and how the tools developers made could influence so many
    different industries.

    Although, I may still be relatively new in my coding journey I'm excited to keep learning more about the tech field and all the awe-inspiring feats it can make reality. Moving forward, I would like to devote myself to projects I find meaningful so that others can also benefit from the tools I create.
